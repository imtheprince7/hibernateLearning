			HIBERNATE
	
	1. The motive of using a hibernate is to skip the SQL part and focus on core java concepts.
	2. Hibernate is java framework that simplifies the development of java application to interact with the database.


Hibernate is an Open source, and Lightweight.
Hibernate is ORM(object relational mapping) tool.

ORM: 
Object which is in our class and relation which is in our table.
It map our class's object(instance ) with tables's entity ( by anootation).



Hibernate is a non-invasive(loosely-coupling) framework,
means it won't force us to extend/implement any class/interface.

Any type of application can build with Hibernate framework.
e.g. ( Swing, FX application Java-web application, SpringBoot / Enterprise application).


========================== Traditional way to Save Data( JDBC) =======================

we have to write all query manually to store object(data) to
database using JDBC.


========================== Hibernate Role  ===========================================

We define instance variable/ class by annotation 
and it write all the code auto-matically.
Hibernate just keep the object(class's instance which is similar to column in table)	 and store in the database.
We have to do only mapping--and call save().
Object---> Hibernate ---> Table.

------------------ we do all the mapping in ( xml / java Annotation.)----------


=============================   POM.XML ========================

To add all the dependency in the project we use POM.XML file.
paste- dependency under <dependencies> </dependencies> 


=====================  MAVEN PROJECT ADVANTAGE ==================
1. Always create maven-based project which help to add dependencies from maven-repository easily
	as compare to adding External-jars in project
	which creates error during compile-time/run-time.

2. we have to only add the dependencied from respository in POM.XML
	and POM.XML will automatically all required jars in project.
		It hold local-global cache [ Local:- download before running the project and store / GLOBAL:- directly from repository
